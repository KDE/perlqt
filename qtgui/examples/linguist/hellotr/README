To use this example, follow the directions found at http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/linguist-hellotr.html

The basic steps are:
Run "lupdate hellotr.pro"
Run "linguist hellotr_la.ts"
    Enter "Orbis, te saluto!" as a translation for "Hello, World!" (don't forget the exclamation mark!).
    Click the "?" to change it to a check mark to mark it done.
    Save the file.
Then either
    Choose "File|Release" in Qt4 Linguist
    Run "lrelease hellotr_la.ts"

Now when you run the example, you'll see the translated text in the PushButton.
