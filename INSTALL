PerlQt version 0.96
===================

For simple installation instructions, see the README file.

This module uses cmake for its build system.  If you don't have it, you can
download the most recent version at
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

=== Makefile.PL ===
The Makefile.PL is just a wrapper around calls to cmake.  Calling
"Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/mycpan QMAKE=/opt/qt/bin/qmake"
is the same thing as running
"cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/mycpan -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/opt/qt/bin/qmake"
Makefile.PL builds an in-source-tree build.  It's a lot easier to get a clean
source tree if you use an out-of-source build, as described below.

=== CMake ===
First, I recommend building the module in its own directory.  Type:
    mkdir build
    cd build

cmake provides a nice 'GUI'ish interface to view compile time options.  To view
this, type either:
    cmake-gui ..

Or if it's not available:
    ccmake ..

Once that finishes, exit with 'q', and type:
    cmake ..

If you just want to use all the default values and paths, you can skip the
ccmake step.

The standard options are:
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = The type of build ('Debug', 'Release', etc)
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = The location for any executables ( e.g. puic4 )
    CUSTOM_PERL_SITE_ARCH_DIR = The location for the perl modules themselves.
    QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE = The path to your system's qmake.

cmake looks in your path for a qmake executable.  If it can't find it, it will
complain and fail to configure properly.  If your qmake is not in your path,
you can tell cmake where to find it by either setting it in ccmake, or on the
commandline with:
    cmake .. -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/my/qmake

Once configured, compile and install with:
    make
    make install
